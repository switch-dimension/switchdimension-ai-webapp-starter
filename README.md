## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (version 18.0 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- A **Clerk account** (free) - [Sign up here](https://clerk.com)

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Features

- âœ… **Protected by Default** - All routes require authentication unless explicitly made public
- âœ… **Clerk Authentication** - Sign in/up with email, social providers
- âœ… **Modern UI** - Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- âœ… **TypeScript** - Full type safety

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/switchdimension-webapp-starter.git
cd switchdimension-webapp-starter
```

### 2. Installation

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Clerk Setup

1. Create a Clerk account at [https://clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Create a new application in your Clerk dashboard
3. Copy your API keys from the Clerk dashboard
4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Clerk Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here


```

### 4. Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the main application.

### 5. Testing Authentication

- Visit any route (protected by default)
- You'll be redirected to Clerk's authentication flow
- After signing in, you'll be redirected back to the main application

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx          # Main application page (protected)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx        # Root layout with Clerk provider and navigation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ profile/          # User profile pages (empty, ready for development)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings/         # Settings pages (empty, ready for development)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ globals.css       # Global styles with Tailwind CSS v4
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware.ts         # Clerk middleware with whitelist approach for public routes
â”œâ”€â”€ components/           # Reusable UI components (empty, ready for development)
â””â”€â”€ lib/                  # Utility functions
```

## Security Model

This starter uses a **whitelist approach** for route protection:

- **All routes are protected by default** - This is the safer approach
- **Public routes must be explicitly defined** in `src/middleware.ts`
- Currently, only Clerk's sign-in/sign-up routes are public
- To add public routes (like landing pages), add them to the `isPublicRoute` matcher in middleware

Example of adding public routes:
```typescript
const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/sign-in(.*)',
  '/sign-up(.*)',
  '/about',        // Add public routes here
  '/contact',      // Add public routes here
])
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
